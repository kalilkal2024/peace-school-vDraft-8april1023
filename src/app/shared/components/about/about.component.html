      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6">Educational Challenges in Rural Area</h2>
      <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-600">
        <p class="mb-4">
          Education is a fundamental right, yet many children from impoverished backgrounds in rural Cambodia face significant barriers to literacy in both Khmer and English. In Prey Veng Province, Kanhchriech District, these challenges persist despite children attending public schools.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Several factors contribute to this issue. Overcrowded classrooms, with an average of 45 students per teacher in public schools, hinder individualized instruction. Additionally, half-day sessions restrict learning time, making it difficult for students to progress academically. Economic disparities further exacerbate the problem; the cost of uniforms, textbooks, and transportation makes education inaccessible for many families. Wealthier students can afford supplementary afternoon classes, widening the achievement gap.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          Parental migration also plays a role, as many parents seek work in urban areas, leaving children without essential academic guidance at home. Rural schools struggle to attract qualified teachers, particularly for English language instruction. As a result, primary students often lack basic English literacy skills, while secondary students begin studying elementary English in Grade 7 without a solid foundation.
